## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher recommended)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Download and Extract

1. Download the project ZIP file from the provided link or repository.
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to your desired location.
3. Open the extracted folder in **Visual Studio Code**.

---

### 2. Backend Setup

1. Open the **integrated terminal** in VS Code.
2. Navigate to the backend directory by typing:
   cd Backend
3. Install the dependencies by running:
   npm install
4. Start the backend server:
   npm start   

   You should see the backend server running on a specific port (e.g., http://localhost:4000).

5. ## Terminal Explanation :  How to access the service.  
   **Open the integrated Terminal where the zip file is extracted**

   **Directory where the zip file is extracted**  
   STEP-0:  C:\Users\Desktop\Documents\College\SpeakX>  
   STEP-1:  cd Backend
            New Path: C:\Users\Desktop\Documents\College\SpeakX\Backend>
   STEP-2:  npm install
   STEP-3:  npm start

   STEP-4:  **After these steps you if you get to see this this means Backend started successfully**
            Client Started
            Express server started on Port 4000
            GRPC Server started on Port 40000
            (node:15064) DeprecationWarning: Calling start() is no longer necessary. It can be safely omitted.
            (Use `node --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)
            Successfully connected to MongoDB Database


### 2. Frontend Setup

1. Open the **new integrated terminal** in VS Code.
2. Navigate to the Frontend directory by typing:
   cd Frontend
3. Install the dependencies by running:
   npm install
4. Start the Frontend:
   npm run dev  

   You should see the Frontend running on a specific port (e.g., http://localhost:5173).

5. ## Terminal Explanation :  How to access the service.  
   **Open the integrated Terminal where the zip file is extracted**

   **Directory where the zip file is extracted**  
   STEP-0:  C:\Users\Desktop\Documents\College\SpeakX>  
   STEP-1:  cd Frontend
            New Path: C:\Users\Desktop\Documents\College\SpeakX\Frontend>
   STEP-2:  npm install
   STEP-3:  npm run dev

   STEP-4:  **After these steps you if you get to see this this means Backend started successfully**
            frontend@0.0.0 dev

            âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
            âžœ  Network: use --host to expose
            âžœ  press h + enter to show help

### 3. Using the Application

1. Open the frontend link (e.g., http://localhost:5173) in your web browser.
2. In the app, type your search query in the provided input field.
3. View the results or responses generated by the application.

### 4. Troubleshooting
Here are common issues and solutions:

1. **Error: Port already in use**
    Ensure no other application is running on the backend or frontend port.
    Close conflicting processes or change the port in the configuration file.

2. **npm command not found**
    Ensure Node.js and npm are properly installed and added to your system's PATH.

3. **Frontend not running**
    Check if the backend is up and running before starting the frontend.

### Conclusion
